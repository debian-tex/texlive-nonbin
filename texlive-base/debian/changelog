  * Add lots of versioned Replaces for files moved between binary packages

  * This packages closes 1.5 RC bugs, thus medium urgency.

texlive-base (2007-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * really install NEWS file for texlive-common [NP]
  * Bump the versioned depends of texlive-common to >= 1.8, in order to
    make sure that the workaround for latex-based formats is present, see
    also Ubuntu bug 122863.

    However, we do not bump the versioned depends of all packages on
    texlive-common to >= 2007-11: For Debian, older 2007 versions will
    surely vanish from the archive, Ubuntu needs to take care
    themselves. [fk]
  * Duplicate the code to recreate missing conffiles from postinst in preinst:
    texlive-base: modes.mf, texlive-latex-base: color/graphics.cfg

texlive-base (2007-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Refine the code to resurrect modes.mf (no version check), and properly
    document it in NEWS.Debian [fk]
  * Also resurrect graphics.cfg and color.cfg, thanks to Bruce MacDonald
    <b.macdonald@auckland.ac.nz> (closes: #427032) [fk]
  * activate mathpple.map (closes: #426790) [np]
  * don't call dh_installtex for meta packages, thus no dependency on
    tex-common is necessary (closes: #427169) [np]

 -- Norbert Preining <preining@debian.org>  Tue, 05 Jun 2007 11:39:35 +0200

texlive-base (2007-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * texlive-full should not depend on tetex-base (Closes: #424023) [np]
  * add stricter dependencies to all packages: if in the final shipout
    dep on a texlive package there is no version given, the value of
    latest-version (from tpm2deb.cfg) of the source package is taken.
  * rename (and not remove) old obsolete config files from tetex
    (Closes: #425256)
  * don't call tetex-bin-upgrade (Closes: #425270)
  * format generation reworked:
    - texlive-base-bin does not provide formats anymore since all the
      respective ini files are in texlive-base
    - texlive-base takes the format generation
  * texlive-common now conflicts with all packages of revisions << than
    the value in latest_revision.
  * Let texlivel-generic-recommended declare Replaces: texlive-base
    because it took over cmyk-hax.tex [fk]

  * make the conflict with ivritex versioned (Closes: #423718) [np]

    lintian override file for tetex-base (Closes: #423520) [np]

 -- Norbert Preining <preining@debian.org>  Mon, 14 May 2007 08:22:01 +0200

texlive-base (2007-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * create tetex-base package to deal with postrm bugginess of tetex-base
    (3.0) and removal of config files of TeX Live. This closes several RC
    bugs, but upgrades from stable still can show these bugs in the case
    that tetex-base is purged at dist-upgrade time.  (Closes: #420490,
    #420390) [np]
  * All the tetex-base package does is remove and deregister with ucf the
    file /etc/texmf/language.d/10tetex.cnf in its postinst script. [fk]
  * This will also lower the severity of bugs of the type "Uninstallable:
    Depends on tetex-base".  These bugs are still important, though,
    because tetex-base does not provide any functionality and will vanish
    after lenny. [fk]
  * blacklist intermediate files in mathpazo doc (Closes: #421620)
  * backport koma-script r288 to fix the use of \usekomafont in all
    koma-script classes (Closes: #421079)

texlive-base (2007-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix the friday 13 bugs: A bad coincidence combined a serious bug in
    debhelper (#419060) produces buggy maintainer scripts in most
    texlive packages. The debhelper bug is fixed, so also the texlive
    packages are fixed (no bug reported agains texlive-base).
  * add texlive-latex-base replaces tetex-bin << 2007 (Closes: #418993)
