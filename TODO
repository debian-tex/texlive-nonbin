- xdvi paper setting is completely hosed, XDvi-paper is *NOT* found!

- how to disable luajittex formats on some archs?

- otf font blacklists and links are generated from lintian files via
  scripts/create-tl-directives, but we do not reevaluate old blacklists
  and change locations
  somehow auto-generating that would be nice, how does lintian do that?
  Checking the contents files I guess?
- links that are bin dir internal are currently generated via links.dist,
  maybe take them from the linked_scripts/Makefile.am, rule
  	bin_links
  that gives the file:link association
  at least some automatic check would be nice.
