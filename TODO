lintian problems:
* properly rebuild texlive-bin ... it has broken debian/changes files
* icc license problem	-> lintian override, new ICC licenses
* privacy break koma-script, needs recheck of the code
* python script but no dep
	tl-science, tl-pictures, tl-extra-utils
  some of them might be dummy, due to the misconception of linian
  on how to find the python interpreter

source missing:
* slideshow.swf ... didn't we remove/ignore that???
* various jquery.js ...

==== 
warnings

duplicate-font-file:
fonts-ipafont-{gothic,mincho} ipaex/ipagp.ttf and ipaex/ipamp.ttf








- how to disable luajittex formats on some archs?

- otf font blacklists and links are generated from lintian files via
  scripts/create-tl-directives, but we do not reevaluate old blacklists
  and change locations
  somehow auto-generating that would be nice, how does lintian do that?
  Checking the contents files I guess?
- links that are bin dir internal are currently generated via links.dist,
  maybe take them from the linked_scripts/Makefile.am, rule
  	bin_links
  that gives the file:link association
  at least some automatic check would be nice.
