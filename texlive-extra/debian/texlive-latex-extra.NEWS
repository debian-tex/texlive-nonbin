texlive-extra (2013.20140212-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * We are sad to announce that flash (swf) files for embedding movies
    into pdf files have been removed due to whatever reasons (see #736802).
    The following files have been removed:
      /usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/latex/flashmovie/player_flv_maxi.swf
      /usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/latex/media9/players/StrobeMediaPlayback.swf
    As a consequence some functionality of the respective packages
    "flashmovie" and "media9" might get lost. If you experience problems,
    install the files manually from the CTAN directories of the
    respective packages.

    We are sorry for the inconveniences, it was not our decision.
