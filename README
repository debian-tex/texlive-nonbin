IMPORTANT NOTE: This file is NOT installed into any Debian package, it is
here only for documentation purpose how to generate the deb source packages
and how in the deb source packages the binary debs are build.

----------------------------------------------------
QUICK HOWTO TO BUILD A SOURCE PACKAGE

. Do NOT create a new .orig.tar.gz, ie only make a new Debian revision,
  or read the whole text
. Put the .orig.tar.gz into ./src/
. edit whatever you have to change, don't forget to change 
  ./$sourcepackage/debian/changelog (it is the debian 
  changelog and defines the version number!)
. call
	perl ./tpm2deb-source.pl make-deb-source $sourcepackage
  where $sourcepackage is one of texlive-{bin,base,extra,doc,lang} or 'all'

After this you should have a normal Debian source package
----------------------------------------------------

===============================

========================================================

0) Documentation of changes
===========================

Please document all changes in 
	all/debian/CHANGES.packaging
It collects all changes which are sometimes only of interest for
us developers. It also gives the release points. 


1) Layout of the directory:
===========================

The 5 directories
	texlive-bin -base -extra -doc -lang
have the same structure like an unpacked source package, ie they contain a
	debian/
subdirectory and optionally other subdirectories.

In addition there is a directory
	all
(also with the same structure as an unpacked source package) which holds 
stuff common for all source packages.

Furthermore there are some files in the top level:

tpm2deb-source.pl
	the central script for building a .orig.tar.gz and a source
	package

tpm.data
	The tpm data from TeX live 2005 as saved via 
		scripts/tpm2deb-tool.pl store-tpm
	call. When starting, tpm2deb-source.pl checks wether this file
	exists and reads it instead of reading all tpm files. This
	speeds up the process a lot, but we shouldn't forget that we
	have to update this with a new version of tpm data when available!

Makefile
	not strictly essential, but it shows what you really have to do
	to generate a source package. Don't forget to call it with the
	correct MASTER setting, e.g. 
		MASTER=/src/TeX/texlive/Master make foobar
	if you have need access to it at the foobar command (mostly
	only at source package build time when you also create a new
	.orig.tar.gz). 

orig.tar.gz-addons/
	This directory contains again directories for each source package,
	and under these dirs files are placed that should be included
	into the .orig.tar.gz

TODO
	well, obvious

scripts/
	test-script.sh 
		this script is called in the pbuilder test run. It tries to
		install the previous version, then with the new version
		install remove install purge 
	simple-test-script.sh
		same as above without installing the previous version, so
		simply install remove install purge
	generate-lin-report.pl
		summarize all the .lintian.log files into one lintian.log
		file, used in Makefile target lintian and linda
	deep-debdiff.sh
		my version of debdiff, used in Makefile target deepdiff
	build-infra
		a script to create package files, releases, signature etc
	tpm2deb-tool.pl
		various additional functions from the old tpm2deb.pl which
		do not fit neither in tpm2deb-bin nor -source, but we might
		need it sometime. Should be updated!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	tex-filter-debdiff.py
		script for filtering debdiff outputs
	
docs/
	README.ftpmaster
		a README I wrote to Jörg for explaining a lot of things
		after the first reject of the packages. Maybe it helps
	tl4debtree.*
		the sources/pdf of the dependency tree pdf
		if you change something, please do not forget to update
		also the respective .uu file in 
		addons-per-source/texlive-doc/debian/tl4deb-deptree.pdf.uu
	source-pkg.txt
		approximate sizes and contents of the source packages
	soon to come hopefully the tugboat article

src/	(maybe not present)
	this contains the last build .orig.tar.gz. If they are present
	new ones are not build. NOT UNDER svn control, so you wont see
	it in a check out, but you could create it and put the orig.tar.gz
	into it ;-)

patches/
	some patches that implement(ed) ideas, some of which were included
	some have been rejected (for now)

etc/
	random stuff


2) Building a new .orig.tar.gz
==============================

The Debian TeXLive repository does not contain the actual sources,
only the files needed to create Debian packages from them.  You have
to get the sources separately. 

Please check out the current tag from the texlive subversion repository,
e.g. for release 2007.0:

	svn co svn://tug.org/texlive/tags/texlive-2007.0

Then call in the texlive-new trunk repository:
	perl tpm2deb-source.pl make-orig-tar --master=/path/to/texlive-2007.0/Master $srcpackage
where $srcpackage is one of texlive-{base,bin,extra,doc,lang}.

This does nothing else than copying all the necessary files from the
Master to the source package directory, adds the stuff from orig.tar.gz-addons,
and creats the orig.tar.gz file from it.

Note that the blacklist: statements (see below) are taking action here, too,
so that blacklisted files and tpms are NOT included in the .orig.tar.gz.


3) Source package build time
============================

Note that for a debian release <= 1 you first have to create a new
.orig.tar.gz, see 2) above. The .orig.tar.gz has to be available at
some place, lets say $SRC.

At source package build time the following actions are taken
	- unpack the .orig.tar.gz
	- copy all the files from ./all/
	- copy all the files from ./$srcpackage/
	- create the rules file from ./all/debian/rules.in
	- create the control file
	- create the lintian override files
	- build the Debian source package with dpkg-source
all this is done with the perl script
	tpm2deb-source.pl

If you want to build a single source package, say texlive-base, call
	perl tpm2deb.pl make-deb-source 		\
		--oldsource=$SRC 			\
		$sourcepackage

NOTE: If you have your .orig.tar.gz in ./src/ then you can leave out the
--oldsource line!
	
As usual, $sourcepackage can be one of texlive-{base,bin,extra,lang,doc}
or 'all' to build all of them.


4) Binary package build time
============================

Besides the rest as found in rules(.in) the main action is taken by
	perl debian/tpm2deb-bin.pl $packages
which does the following for each binary package $pkg
	- copy all the files to debian/$pkg/u/s/texmf-texlive/...
	  this honors the remap/blacklist/etc directives in the 
	  config file (see below).
	  Main function here is the do_remap_and_copy function.
	- next the Execute statements from the tpm files are executed
	  This can be addMap, BuildFormat, BuildLanguage
	  For the three cases the respective files in /etc/texmf/updmap.d,
	  fmt.d, language.d are created and the list files in
	  /v/l/tex-common/.... (ie it takes the job of dh_installtex)
	- next work on the SpecialActions as defined in the config file
	  currently only install-info for .info files
	  in this case a debian/$binpkg.info file is created for the
	  dh_installinfo call later on in the debian/rules file
	- finally the maintainer scripts are created (see below 5a)
After this the debian/rules file continues and does the following 
(current situation) for each $binpkg:
	- merge the files from debian/$binpkg.root into the install dir
	- generate the license file
	- remove the tpm files
	- install lintian override, bug script and control files
	- create the necessary doc links in /u/s/texlive-doc
	- if present, add the shipped debian/$binpkg.links.dist to 
	  debian/$binpkg.links (in earlier revision I think to remember
	  that tpm2deb(-bin).pl created $binpkg.links, but this is not
	  done anymore AFAIS, so this whole stuff could be deleted)
	- create the README.Debian files from the package specific 
	  and the general one.
...


4.1) I need to add/change files, where should I do that
=======================================================

There are 3 places where files can be changed/added:

4.1a) add a file to the orig.tar.gz
--------------------------------
just drop the file into orig.tar.gz-addons/<src-package>/.... and it will
be included as soon as you rebuild a .orig.tar.gz file. Example:
  orig.tar.gz-addons/texlive-lang/texmf-dist/tex/csplain/base/csplain.ini
which was necessary due to the fixed license statement.

Remember that you can *remove* a file in the .orig.tar.gz file using the
tpm2deb directive
  blacklist;file;...

Time done: at .orig.tar.gz build time
Advantage: you can add binary files without encoding etc
Disadvantage: rebuilding of .orig.tar.gz, and it is getting *unclean*

4.1b) add the file via the .diff.gz
--------------------------------
just drop a file into trunk/<src-package>/...
No binary files possible
Example:
  texlive-bin/texmf/doc/man/man1/dvipos.1

Time done: at source patching time, before building
Advantage: the usual Debian way, but it circumvents quilt
Disadvantage: no binary files possible

4.1c) add the file to the finished tree
------------------------------------
you can add files to the *final* tree by putting them into
  trunk/<src-package>/debian/<bin-package-name>.root/
Example:
  trunk/texlive-base/debian/texlive-latex-base.root/usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/latex/fancyhdr/fancyheadings.sty
adds the file fancyheadings to the final package texlive-latex-base.

Time done: after build time, before actually packaging the debs (more or less)
Advantage: binary files can be included .uu encoded and are automatically
  decoded
Disadvantage: ???


5) Special stuff
================

5a) maintainer scripts handling
-------------------------------

sub make_maintainer in all/debian/tpm2deb-bin.pl

The invocations of various commands (update-*, build_format etc) are 
automatically generated from the various Execute statements in the 
tpm files. But you can add stuff *before* and *after* the
automatically generated code by adding scripts 
	$srcpackage/debian/$binpackage.$maintainerscript.{pre,post}
so the final maintainer scripts look like this:

$package.postinst
	included $package.postinst.pre
	generated code for $package.postinst
	included $package.postinst.post
and so on.

5b) Changelogs
--------------
All changes are collected in CHANGES.packaging (which is also installed into
the doc directory). The relevant changes must be merged by hand into the
respective changelog files
	$srcpackage/debian/changelog
by calling dch <args> -c $srcpackage/debian/changelog

5c) Other special files handling
--------------------------------
Some other special files also contain automatically generated content, but
can be augmented with additional text *at the beginning* by dropping files
into addons-per-bin/:
	README.Debian:
		$srcpackage/debian/$binpackage.README
	$package.links:
		$srcpackage/debian/$binpackage.links.dist
	Licenses:
		$srcpackage/debian/$binpackage.Licenses.add
So the final README.Debian for $package contains first a present
$srcpackage/debian/$binpackage.README followed by the automatically 
generated stuff, in this case followed by the content of 
all/debian/README.Debian.

The final debian/$binpackage.links (input for dh_link) contains first the
content if present of $srcpackage/debian/$binpackage.links.dist followed by the
automatically generated list.

The final Licenses contains first all/debian/Licenses.header,
then if present the file $srcpacakge/debian/$binpackage.Licenses.add 
followed by the automatically generated content
(generated by all/debian/generate-license-file).

5d) rules.in, tpm.data, lintian.override
----------------------------------------
rules.in
	An eperl script from which the real debian/rules file is
	generated at source package build time. It is called with
		-d arch=[any|all]
		-d srcpackage=texlive-[bin|base|extra|doc|lang]
		-d binpackages="list of bin packages of the respective src pkg"


lintian.override
	Gives the lintian override file lines, either without a package
	name, than the current bin package name is used, or with one,
	then the line is copied directly.
	I haven't found a better place for this file for now.



6) Config file syntax and semantic
==================================
The config file for building the orig.tar.gz, the source package and the
bin package is located in
	all/debian/tpm2deb.cfg

arch;<package>;<arch>
	defines that the source package <package> has architecture <arch>
	default is "all" for <arch>
source;<pkgname>
	defines that <pkgname> is a source package, so if make_deb_source
	is called with argument "all" then these packages are build
maintainer;<package>|*;maintainer
	defines the maintainer for <package> or all packages
uploaders;<package>|*;uploaders
	defines the uploaders for <package> or all packages
section;<package>|*;section
	defines the section for <package> or all packages
priority;<package>|*;priority
	defines the priority for <package> or all packages
standards;<package>|*;standard
	defines the standards release
texlive-common-version;version
	minimal texlive-common version all packages depend on
latest-version;<srcpackage>;version
	latest version the texlive-full package depend on
	need not be the real latest greatest release
name;<tl-name>;<debian-name>;<debian-source>
	define a debian package:
	<tl-name> is the collection, like collection-latexextra
	<debian-name> is the name of the binary pkg: texlive-latex-extra
	<debian-source> maps this package into the source package
title;<tpm>;<title>
	changes the title of a tpm which will be used in the descriptions
description;<binpackage>;<description>
	gives the description in the control file
	this can be multi lined, so all lines are concatenated
move;<tpmname>;<binpkg>
	move a tpm to another package (debian name for <binpkg>!)
<relation>;<pkgname>;text
	where <relation> is in depends, recommends, build-dep, suggests,
	provides, replaces, conflicts
blacklist;tpm;<tpmname>;<in-which-collection>
	blacklist a whole tpm <tpmname>. the last entry gives
	either * for all collections, or the name of a binary package
	in which the tpm is blacklisted
	blacklist is applied at ORIG build time and naturally at binary 
	build time, so this way DFSG incompatible stuff can be excluded
	from the .orig.tar.gz
blacklist;file;<origfilename>
	blacklist a file <origfilename>. The file name refers to the
	file name in UPSTREAM source (as listed in tpm files).
	It is a perl regexp!!!! 
	Otherwise works as above.
special;<filename>;<tag>
	currently only allowed for <tag> is "install-info"
	which installs the file <filename> via pkg.info and dh_installinfo
extra;format;<formatname>;<binarypkg>;<flag>
	currently only extra is "format" (as given) which allows to add
	additional calls to format generation in addition to the ExecuteActions
	in the tpm files.
	<formatname> is the format to be build via fmtutil-sys --byname
	<binarypkg> is the package name in which it is executed
	<flag> = 0	build_format --byfmt $fmt
	       = 1	build_format_if_format_exists --byfmt $fmt
	       o.w.	build_format_if_file_exists --byfmt $fmt <flag>
execute;tpm;actionline
	add an additional Execute statement to a tpm
	does the same as an entry in the tpm file
mapping;<origfilename>;<action>;<arg>
	controls the installation of files

	Note that "add as a config file" is *not* intended to register
	each conf(ig)file.  Instead it means that the file was a
	conffile in TL 2005, and its *move* needs to be handled
	properly for a conffile.

	<origfilename> (perl regexp) is the file which should be installed
	<arg> normally contains file names with possibly contained 
		backreferences (like $1) to sub-patterns in the <origfilename>
		Filenames can be either given as relative paths, in this
		case /usr/share/texmf-texlive is prepended, or as abolute
		pathnames.
	<action> = move, = config-move
		the orig file is moved to <arg>
		in the case of config-move <arg> is added as config file
		= copy, = config-copy
		the orig file is copied to <arg>
		in the case of config-copy <arg> is added as config file
		create a symlink from <origfilename> to <arg>
		= copy-move
		<arg> is "<confabsolutepath>,<otherabsolutepath>"
		the orig file is moved to <confabsolutepath> and
		copied to <otherabsolutepath>
		= link
		make <origfilename> a symlink to <arg>, but do not create <arg>
		= move-link
		combination of move and link:
		move <origfilename> to <arg> (see above) and in addition
		= add-link
		install <origfilename> normally and add a symlink <arg> to it
		= replace-link
		<arg> must be aaa%bbb where aaa is a symlink to bbb
		=   (empty)
		just forget the file
		the difference to blacklist is that special actions can still
		be carried out


7) License Information Procedure
================================

Once in a while and after Catalogue update:
-------------------------------------------
create a file tpm:licstring where tpm is an arbitrary tpm name (without
the .tpm) and licstring is the license string as obtained from the catalogue.

done with tpm2license, see Makefile

At bin package build time:
--------------------------
see debian/rules, the script generate-license-information is called, which
in turn calls tpm2licenses.

For now ignore the remap/etc stuff from tpm2deb.cfg
